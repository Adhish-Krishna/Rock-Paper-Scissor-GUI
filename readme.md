# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game created using Python and the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows a player to compete against the computer with random move generation. I did this project in my 12th grade.

## Features
- **User-friendly GUI**: Built with the Tkinter library.
- **Single-player mode**: Play against the computer.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins, losses, and draws.
